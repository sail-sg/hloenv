Examples of using HloEnv
========================

This documentation only covers the Python interface. We will walk through two simple examples that make use of several HloEnv features. We first show how to read in an HLO text file and turn it into HLO graph features which can be used for implementing a user-defined decision-making agent. We then present a very simple decision-making agent where the policy randomly choose from available actions.
